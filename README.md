# Project Title: Data Professional Survey Breakdown
This is my first Power BI Guided Project at the beginner level. Here i used sample data set from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst

Project Overview:
The goal of the 'Data Professional Survey Breakdown' project was to dissect and understand the diverse landscape of data professionals' preferences, skills, and challenges.
To achieve this, I meticulously curated and analyzed a dataset consisting of survey responses from data professionals across different industries and roles.

Dashboard Elements:

The project's dashboard was meticulously crafted using a diverse array of visualizations to best convey the findings. 
It featured:

Card: The card visualization succinctly showcased key metrics, such as the total number of survey respondents and the average age among data professionals.

Bar Chart: The bar chart elegantly illustrated the distribution of average salary by job title among the respondents 

Donut Chart: With the donut chart, I artistically conveyed the percentage breakdown of data professionals based on their gender and avg salary.

Tree Map: The tree map visualization provided an insightful hierarchical view of the various location within the data field

Gauge: The gauge visualization offered an engaging representation of job and management satisfaction levels reported by the survey participants, enabling a quick grasp of the overall sentiment.

Through the judicious application of Power BI's tools, I gleaned invaluable insights from the data:

1. The role of Data Scientist emerged as a standout, with a notably higher average salary compared to other roles, underscoring the demand and value attributed to this position.
2. Python secured its position as the most preferred programming language among data professionals, signifying its pivotal role in the data ecosystem.
3. A captivating revelation was that gender preference did not significantly impact the salary distribution among data professionals, highlighting a relatively equitable compensation landscape.
4. The gauge visualization indicated an overall positive sentiment among data professionals for their job and immediate management. However, this positive sentiment did not necessarily translate into an overall high level of job satisfaction, suggesting room for improvement at the organizational level.
